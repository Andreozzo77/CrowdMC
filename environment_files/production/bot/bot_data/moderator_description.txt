On EliteStar, we are always looking for active and experienced players willing to volunteer their time to help out in any way possible, both in our in-game server and in the Discord community. As our server grows larger and larger each day, a larger and more active staff team is required. If you think you meet the criteria to help moderate the server, don't hesitate to apply! Take a few minutes of your time to submit this form and volunteer for Helper at EliteStar! We are always receiving and reviewing new staff applications. We do not believe it is necessary to put an age restriction, since we know that maturity can arrive sooner or later in the life of every individual. With this being said, you can comfortably apply regardless of age. The requirements for being mod are not hand-crafted, but you have to dedicate a reasonable amount time each day. We must see you working and trying your best to get better at your job and working with the rest of the team. While the activity is an important note, you are not forced to comply with any exaggerated margin of daily hours. Our intention is not to put any stress on our team, simply to ensure that you are doing things right! To apply, simply answer a few questions below, being as descriptive as possible. The way you write your application will significantly increase your chances of becoming a part of our staff team. There are length requirements in place for certain fields in which we want you to expand more on your ideas, and why you believe you are a good candidate. Do not bypass any questions or spam this form, or we will discard your application instantly.
